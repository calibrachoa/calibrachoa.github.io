# Rooots

2D arcade rush game where, to keep the timer from reaching 0, the player must source water using the tree's roots, and to make points, they must place as many leaves as they can.

## The goal

In a team of 5, complete a small game in 2 days following the **Global Game Jam 2023**'s theme: roots. 

## My contributions

- **Participating in the design of the game.** We chose to make a tiny arcade rush game where there are 2 types of roots to place: sourcing roots, that can absorb water from the earth's underground plants, and point roots that must be above the ground's surface. This very simple design added 2 challenges to our game: 
    1. A management challenge, because both types of roots had to be taken care of, one in order to survive and the other in order to make the high score;
    2. A tactics challenge, because in a few clicks, the sourcing roots have to cover a wide range of terrain to collect water. As you play, the game grows in difficulty, notably because the tree gets bigger and the player has more ground to cover.
- **Integrating the art into the game**, making the textures and shader to decorate the different assets such as the roots, the leaves and the background.
