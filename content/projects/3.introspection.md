# Introspection

2.5D Beat 'em up 2-player networking game made during the **Ubisoft Game Lab Competition 2022**. We were a team of 6 students. Play as Determination or Distraction and help a student finish their school year with good grades. I was a programmer on that project, focusing mainly on the character abilities, the enemies' AI and the UI.
