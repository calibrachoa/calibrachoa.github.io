#title
Hi, I am Justine. I am here to share the joy!
#description
- I love making games, from getting a first idea to the never-ending bug hunting. I'm so lucky it is my job!
- I completed a 1-year Game Design programme at [**Vancouver Film School**](https://vfs.edu/) (Oct. 2022 - Oct. 2023).
- I used to work/study in the software engineering & operation research field. I even wrote a [**master's thesis** on the subject of cooperative game theory](https://doi.org/1866/27950).
- Besides designing amazing games, my goal is to be a good team member/leader, with communication skills and finesse to navigate relationships and project deliveries at work.
